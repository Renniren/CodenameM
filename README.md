# CodenameM
Codename M (working title) is a platform fighter that is built from the ground up to allow you to personalize it to your tastes and likings - to be the M.U.G.E.N of Smash clones.

Codename M is completely open-source, meaning that instead of asking that you create your own content for the game through some kind of API, you can directly modify and compile the game yourself with the version of Unity used within the game's production.
